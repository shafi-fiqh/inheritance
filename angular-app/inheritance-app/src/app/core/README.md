# CORE MODULE

The CoreModule takes on the role of the app root module, but is not the module that gets bootstrapped by Angular at run-time. The common denominator between the files present here is that we only need to load them once, and that is at run-time, which makes them singleton. The module contains root-scoped services, static components like the navbar and footer, interceptors, guard, constants, enums, utils, and universal models.
